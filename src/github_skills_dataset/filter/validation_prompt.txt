Analyze this SKILL.md file from GitHub.

A valid Claude Code skill file has:
1. YAML frontmatter between --- markers (at the start)
2. Markdown content after frontmatter
3. Content that extends Claude's capabilities (instructions, workflows, knowledge, or commands)

Common frontmatter fields (all optional):
- name, description, disable-model-invocation, user-invocable, allowed-tools

The content can be:
- Reference material (API conventions, patterns, style guides)
- Task instructions (step-by-step workflows like deploy, commit)
- Templates or examples
- Configuration for tools/agents

Be INCLUSIVE - if it has frontmatter + markdown content that looks skill-like, mark as valid.
Reject only if clearly not a skill (blog posts, GitHub templates, unrelated docs).

File content:
{content}

Respond with JSON only:
{{"is_skill": true/false, "reason": "one sentence"}}
